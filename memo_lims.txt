with basicTex we have to install 'courier' and 'helvetic'
sudo tlmgr install courier
sudo tlmgr install helvetic

we installed R package devtools that seems to allow working with Rstudio console

then to build the package
R CMD build lims
R CMD check lims
R CMD rd2pdf lims // to build only the documentation
